# Arcticons-selfhosted - Arcticons for self-hosted dashboards!


**NOTICE: this is an unofficial WIP. I'll probably showcase this to Arcticons-team later, when I have the time to, but for now it stays here as demo.**

## Usage

See website to search for icons, or search directly on this Github repo.

## Contribute

To contribute icons:

1. Add them to the `/newicons` folder in a pull request.
2. Assign a category for them in `/newicons/appfilter.json`. The current categories are:
    - **selfhosted**: Selfhosted apps
    - **languages**: Programming languages
    - **emojis**: List of emojis
    - **distros**: Linux distributions and other OSes
    - **other**: Miscellaneous stuff related to self-hosting e.g. Cloudflare logo

Icons shall follow [contribution guidelines](https://docs.arcticons.com/contribute/creating-icons) and the [Knowledge Base](https://docs.arcticons.com) tutorials.

Tips: 

- Please name icons with underscores as spaces (e.g. `jitsi_meet.svg` instead of `jitsimeet.svg`) so they can be transformed to proper titles (`Jitsi Meet`).
- A lot of icons may already exist in the [main repo for Android](https://github.com/Arcticons-team/Arcticons), you can copy-paste them and add proper categories.

## Requests

Please file an issue, preferably with link(s) to the logo(s).
