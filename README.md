## Usage

See website to search for icons, or search directly on this Github repo.

For simplicity, icons are not categorized. This feature may be considered later if there is enough demand.

## Contribute

To contribute icons, add them to the `/newicons` folder in a pull request. Icons shall follow contribution guidelines and the tutorials in the [Knowledge Base](https://docs.arcticons.com).

> Note: Please name icons with proper underscores as spaces (e.g. `jitsi_meet.svg` instead of `jitsimeet.svg`) so they can be transformed to proper titles (`Jitsi Meet`).

## Requests

Please file an issue, preferably with link(s) to the logo(s).
